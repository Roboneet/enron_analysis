Examining realtion btw financial features such as loans and salary to identify poi
Naive Bayes
1. Basic model to predict on the training features:
recall: 0.705
precision: 0.210
2. Divided model into trainnig and testing data:
recall: 0.8
precision: 0.15

very poor precision and very good recall

Examining relation between 'salary','loan_advances','director_fees', 'bonus','long_term_incentive', 'total_payments', 'from_this_person_to_poi','from_poi_to_this_person'
1. Using decision tree :
recall : 0.0
precision : 0.0

Oh boy ! just when I thought things can't get any worse.


Okay.. new plans ! Follow the rubric to make my life easy
Part 1:
Understanding the dataset and question

A. Data exploration:
	Out of the 146 data points , 18 are known to be pois.
	Out of the 21 features available, 4 features , deferral_payments, loan_advances, restricted_stock_deferred and director_fees, have too less information associated with them ( more than 100 NaN points ). Hence, these features should not be used for the analysis.
