Examining realtion btw financial features such as loans and salary to identify poi
Naive Bayes
1. Basic model to predict on the training features:
recall: 0.705
precision: 0.210
2. Divided model into trainnig and testing data:
recall: 0.8
precision: 0.15

very poor precision and very good recall

Examining relation between 'salary','loan_advances','director_fees', 'bonus','long_term_incentive', 'total_payments', 'from_this_person_to_poi','from_poi_to_this_person'
1. Using decision tree :
recall : 0.0
precision : 0.0

Oh boy ! just when I thought things can't get any worse
